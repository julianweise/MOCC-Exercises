We chose a mix of different mobile service providers (e.g. Telekom, O2 and Vodafone), which changed the initial placing of the clusters.
Additionally, we modified the number of iterations as well as the number of paritions.
Overall, we combined the following sets:
MNC = {Telekom, O2, Vodafone}
K   = {1.000, 10.000}
iter= {20, 100}

The resulting outputs vastly different in their runtime, where more iterations and more paritions resulted in longer runtimes.

Regarding the results, we noticed that more clusters (k) caused the overall output data to be more fine grained.
The impact of more iterations however, is barely noticable.
